            I would like to write something about Ed Sheeran, just because he's a great artist and I love his songs :3
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>I have been listening to his songs since his biggest hit, <b>Thinking Out Loud</b> came out in the fall of 2014 (Now, only behind his song Shape of You) and since then I was in love with his songs. And besides being a great artists, he is also an exceptional guitar player.</span>
        </p>

        <div>I just <b>fell in love</b> with his guitar skills and how he innovates new beats and sounds only with his guitar to give a background effect to the songs he performs at live concerts. </div>

        <p>
            He was the <strong>main reason</strong> I started to develop my interest in <em>playing guitar</em>. Here's his picture if you don't still somehow know who I am talking about.<br>
